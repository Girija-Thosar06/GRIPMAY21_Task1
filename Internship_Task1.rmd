GRIPMAY21 : TASK1 : Prediction using supervised ML

```{r}
# loading the libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(statsr)
```
```{r}
# loading the dataset from the url provided
data = read.csv(url("http://bit.ly/w-data"))
```



Now lets check the dataset


```{r}
head(data)
```


Using 'geom_point' function to create the scatter plot of the response variable (scores) and the explanatory variable (hours)

 
```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Hours, y = Scores)) +
  geom_point()
```

From the graph we can see that there is a linear relationship between the response variable and explanatory variable. Also the direction of association seems positive.


```{r}
# Checking the correlation between the two variables.
cor(data$Scores,data$Hours)
```
We see a highly positive correlation between scores and hours.

```{r}
# Writing the model where Scores (response variable) is a function of Hours (explanatory variable)
model = lm(Scores ~ Hours, data = data)
summary(model)
```


The model can be interpreted as :
Predicted Scores = 9.7758 * Hours + 2.4837.
Here $R^2$ = 0.9529. I t is the strength of the fit of a linear model.

```{r}
# adding the regression line
plot(data$Hours,data$Scores)
abline(model)
```

```{r}
plot(data$Hours,model$fitted.values)
```

Checking actual score values of top 3 observations

```{r}
head(data,n=3)
```

Now checking the predicted scores for the above mentioned observations
```{r}
test1 = data.frame(Hours = c(2.5,5.1,3.2))

predict(model, test1)
```

Now when the hours = 9.25, what is the predicted score
```{r}
# Now when the hours = 9.25, what is the predicted score
test2 = data.frame(Hours = 9.25)

predict(model, test2)
```
SO the predicted score is 92.90
